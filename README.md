# GKLanka-Quotation

GK Lanka International (Pvt) Ltd is a startup company for installing solar panel systems. They needed to generate a quotation documents for give their customers. They did it manually using word processing softwares. But then they wanted to generate quotation documents through a web application. As the first step, they ask for simple web application that can insert quotation information and then generate the quotation PDF document. 
<br/>
This was an immediate requirement and I created the interface for get inputs and another file for generate PDF. Both files are written in PHP using HTML,CSS and JavaScript. 
I used mPDF library for the pdf generating part. 

<hr/>
If you want to run this application, you have to install mPDF library setup in this directory (parrelall to 'ongrid2.php' file) on your host/localhost by using
<br/>
<b> $ composer require mpdf/mpdf </b>
<br/> command.

This is an example quotation document with its original naming format.
