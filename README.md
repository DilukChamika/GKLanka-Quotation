# GKLanka-Quatation

GK Lanka International (Pvt) Ltd is a startup company for installing solar panel systems. They just wanted to generate a quatation documents for give their customers. They did it manually using word processing softwares. But then they wanted to generate quatation documents through a web application. As the first step, they ask for simple web application that can insert quatation information and then generate the quatation PDF document. 

This was an immediate requirement and I created the interface for get inputs and another file for generate PDF. Both files are written in php using html,css and javascript. 
I used mPDF library for the pdf generating part. 

If you want to run this application, you have to install mPDF setup in this directory by using
<br/>
<b> $ composer require mpdf/mpdf </b>
<br/> command.

<br/>
This is an example quatation document with its original naming format.
